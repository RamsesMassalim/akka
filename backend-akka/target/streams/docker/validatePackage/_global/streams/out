[warn] [1] There are no exposed ports for your docker image
[warn]  Configure the `dockerExposedPorts` or `dockerExposedUdpPorts` setting. E.g.
[warn] 
[warn]  // standard tcp ports
[warn]  dockerExposedPorts ++= Seq(9000, 9001)
[warn] 
[warn]  // for udp ports
[warn]  dockerExposedUdpPorts += 4444
[warn]           
[warn] [2] sbt-native-packager wasn't able to identify the docker version. Some features may not be enabled
[warn] sbt-native packager tries to parse the `docker version` output. This can fail if
[warn] 
[warn]   - the output has changed:
[warn]     $ docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'
[warn] 
[warn]   - no `docker` executable is available
[warn]     $ which docker
[warn] 
[warn]   - you have not the required privileges to run `docker`
[warn] 
[warn] You can display the parsed docker version in the sbt console with:
[warn] 
[warn]   sbt:your-project> show dockerApiVersion
[warn] 
[warn] As a last resort you could hard code the docker version, but it's not recommended!!
[warn] 
[warn]   import com.typesafe.sbt.packager.docker.DockerApiVersion
[warn]   dockerApiVersion := Some(DockerApiVersion(1, 40))
[warn]           
[success] All package validations passed
